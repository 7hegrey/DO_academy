      <h1>DeepOnion Academy</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Prior to gaining DeepPoints you need to complete this little educational form, to make us understand you are aware of the rules.
      This is in English for now, but if you are Russian or Chinese (or any of the other languages with active moderators ToDo:which languages)
      you are welcome to write in your native language.
    </p>
    <form class="" action="index.html" method="post">
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Code of conduct</legend>
        <p>
          Always follow the rules currently in effect. You can find the current rules here:
          <a href="link to rules">DeepOnion Rules and guidelines</a> ToDo: Link
        </p>
        <label for="rules_repeat">Repeat this with your own words in the textfield.</label>
        <textarea name="rules_repeat" rows="8" cols="80"></textarea>
        <p>
          Before you post, search for other posts. Some times google can be better than the internal search, so try both.
          A google search for content on the DeepOnion forum could look like this: "deeponion.org install wallet" or "deeponion airdrop rules"
        </p><p>
          <label for="search_repeat">Repeat this with your own words in the textfield.</label>
          <textarea name="search_repeat" rows="8" cols="80"></textarea>
        </p><p>
          As a member of the DeepOnion community you are expected to have some minimum knowledge about cryptocurrencies,
          blockchains and the DeepOnion products themselves. It is ok to register and use the forum even if you don't have this knowledge,
          but it is not accepted to create posts asking for basic information that is easily found with a search.
        </p>

          <textarea name="knowledge_repeat" rows="8" cols="80"></textarea>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Keep in mind that there is a real risk to have your DeepPoints removed, and being banned for a period or time and even permanently.</strong>

        <legend>Your social media accounts</legend>
        <p>
          You don't have to add any account, but if you are going to do DeepDomination tasks on the social media platforms,
          the proof have to show the account you enter here.
          If you don't add an account, you cannot get points for these tasks.
          The accounts have to be at least 1 month old.
